There was a time when it was just a story just written in my journal. and then i suddenly thought to make a short about it and then i wrote the script and it was just awesome i just never got the time to complete it. I know it took so much time and i spent all of the duriong my exams it was such a awesome time to just push myself to extreme!! I don't have a lot to say but yea you can just look at the film.
